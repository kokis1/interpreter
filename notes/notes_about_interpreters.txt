Components of an interpreter:

Lexer:
takes the text and breaks it into tokens

Parser:
takes the stream of tokens and produces an abstract syntax tree (AST) from them

Interpreter:
takes the AST and interprets what it should mean

Token:
a symbol/small series of symbols that have a specified meaning (like an integer or operator)

AST:
a data type used to represent the structure of the program
